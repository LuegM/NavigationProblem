## Problem description
I am in the process of creating an app which uses a NavigationSplitView with 2 columns in the first view (left search box & right map).

On the map there is a button which leads to a dashboard. 
The dashboard uses a NavigationSplitView with 3 columns.

Can anyone help me how to navigate from one NavigationView to the other without ending up like shown in the the images below? (the second NavigationSplitView is stuffed into the first)

I am also trying to do the same on iPhones from a NavigationStack to a NavigationSplitView. 
Of course I have several navigation bars.

here are the images...
